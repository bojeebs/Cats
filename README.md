### MVP Goals

1. App.js, Nav, and several fish card components can add more if needed.

2. Routes to fish details on each card 

3. Each card will have unique information on each card

### Post-MVP

1. Add more fish

2. Add links to fish details that lead back to home page & a next button that leads to the next fish instead. 

3. Much more detailed cards with more scientific information or links to outside sites about conservation. 

4. Figure out a way to render TONS of fish or fish at random. Even a search bar.
