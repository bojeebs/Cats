3. Each card will have unique information on each card

### Post-MVP

1. Add more cats

2. Add links to cat details that lead back to home page & a next button that leads to the next cat instead. 

3. Much more detailed cards with more scientific information or links to outside sites about healthcare and needs.

4. Figure out a way to render TONS of cats or cat at random. Even a search bar.
